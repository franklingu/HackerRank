### Instroduction
[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a very good website to practice all sort of programming problems and its problem database is growing very fast.

One particularly interesting track is functional programming. From my observation most Computer Science students, including me, lack of knowledge in functional programming -- they are good at object oriented and procedural programming in most cases. However, functional programming is fun and most importantly useful and powerful with ideas like immutable data strucutre, function composition, carried function and so on.

So in this repo I am learning some functional programming languages via this track and post my solutions. Any suggestions and PRs are welcomed.
