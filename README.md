[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a very good website to practice all sort of programming problems and its problem database is growing very fast. Beiing a coder, we want to actively keep our coding skills sharpened and ready to tackle different problems all the time. So let code on!

All sort of suggestions and contributions are welcomed. Currently I am just putting down my "two cents" for sharing.
